# Junie Context for Frontend Development

## Project Structure
This is a FRONTEND-ONLY project. The backend is a separate Spring Boot application.

## API Integration
- All backend API endpoints are documented in endpoints-summary.txt
- Always check endpoints-summary.txt first when implementing API calls
- Never attempt to search for backend code in this project
- Use Axios for all API requests

## Common Patterns
When implementing API calls:
1. First check endpoints-summary.txt for the correct endpoint path and parameters
2. Use the Axios examples provided in the documentation
3. Follow the response structure documented for each endpoint
