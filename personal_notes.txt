ADVICE ON REACT PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE:

When it comes to React projects, having a clean and scalable directory structure is crucial for long-term maintenance and
development efficiency. Since you're planning to use routing and have multiple components, let's go through some widely
accepted best practices for your project structure inside the `src` folder.

### **Recommended Folder Structure**

Here's a typical way to structure your project for clarity and scalability:

```
/src
|-- /assets
|   |-- /images
|   |-- /styles
|-- /components
|   |-- /common
|   |-- /layout
|-- /pages
|   |-- /Home
|   |   |-- /components
|   |   |-- Home.tsx
|   |-- /About
|   |   |-- /components
|   |   |-- About.tsx
|   |-- /Contact
|   |   |-- /components
|   |   |-- Contact.tsx
|-- /services
|-- /utils
|-- /hooks
|-- /types
|-- App.tsx
|-- main.tsx
|-- routes.tsx
```

### **Folder Details and Best Practices**

- **`/assets`**: This directory will store static files like images and styles. Keeping them separate from your logical
code helps in managing them better.

- **`/components`**: General components that are used across various pages should be stored here. It’s a good practice to
further organize this directory into subdirectories like `/common` for very widely used components (like buttons and inputs)
and `/layout` for layout components (like headers and footers).

- **`/pages`**: Each page of your application should have its own directory within the `/pages` folder. It’s a common
practice to name these directories after the pages themselves (e.g., Home, About, Contact).

    - **Subfolder `/components`**: For components that are specifically used within a particular page and not reused
    elsewhere, create a subfolder inside the page folder. This keeps page-specific components organized and easy to
    manage as your application grows.

- **`/services`**: For handling external interactions like API calls. Keeping them in one place makes your components
cleaner and your services more reusable.

- **`/utils`**: Utility functions that are used across the application.

- **`/hooks`**: Custom hooks for your application to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.

- **`/types`**: TypeScript types, interfaces, or enums that are used globally across your application.

- **`routes.tsx`**: Centralizing your routing in one file makes it easier to manage. It uses components from `/pages` to render based on the route.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Modularity**: Keep your components small, focused, and reusable where possible.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent and clear naming conventions. For TypeScript files,
use `.tsx` if they contain JSX code; otherwise, use `.ts`.
- **Lazy Loading**: Consider using React's lazy loading for pages to improve load times, especially
if the app size grows.

This structure provides a solid foundation as your application scales up, while also keeping it organized and
maintainable. Always tailor the structure based on the specific needs and complexity of your project.
